# CaesarBreaker
The program can encrypt with Caesar encryption on the one hand and decrypt on the other. It can also decrypt an encrypted ciphertext without a key. It is important to note that the longer the ciphertext, the more likely it is to be decrypted. Furthermore, there is only a German bruteforce mode so far. Other languages may come later.
